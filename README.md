# TIC TAC TOE Game Application

For my first application I created a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game application where users can authenticate themselves, play the game and view all of the games played.

## Technologies Used:

* HTML
* CSS/SASS
* JavaScript
* JQuery
* AJAX
* Bootstrap
* Git
* GitHub


## User Stories & Wireframes:
* User(s) can create an account by signing up with email & password.
* User(s) can sign in with their credentials.
* User(s) can change password after being authenticated.
* User(s) can initiate a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.
* User(s) can play a simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe until X || O wins or until the game ties.
* User(s) can view the total amount of games played.
* User(s) can sign out and deauthenticate themselves.

## Planning & Development:

* The intial plan to tackle this project consisted of user stories and wireframes designs, simple user authentication forms, reliable pseudocode to guide me through the game logic, and minimalistic styling to highlight the game features.
* Writing pseudocode to create the logic quickly became one of the hardest aspects of the project due to lack of experience. However, thinking through the problem and conceptualzing the logic behind the game laid the foundation to achieve success as it taught me how to collaborate with peers, and solve problems incrementally.
* Lastly the styling was not as simple as I thought initally because centering the game grid while keeping all the boxes aligned required some testing and experimentation. 


## Unsolved Problems / Future Improvements:

* Integrate toast notifications.
* Improve user interface.
* Below are some cutting-edge features I strive to integrate in future versions of the app,
  - Multiplayer mode
  - Ai integration
  - Ability to return to unfinished games.
